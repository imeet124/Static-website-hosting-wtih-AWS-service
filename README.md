Static Website Hosting on AWS

This project demonstrates static website hosting using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The website files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, which is configured to serve static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By leveraging AWS's scalable and reliable infrastructure, the website is delivered quickly and efficiently to users.

Key Features:

Amazon S3: Used for storing and serving static website files.
Static Website Hosting: Enabled via S3 to handle HTTP requests directly.
Scalability: Automatically scales to handle traffic spikes without additional configuration.
Cost-Effective: Pay only for the storage and bandwidth you use.
